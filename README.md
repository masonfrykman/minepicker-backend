# minepicker-backend

The server backend application, intended to run on a machine that can be connected to using the [frontend](https://github.com/masonfrykman/minepicker) in which the Linux or macOS machine running this software can have Minecraft instances run on it.

For some reason I didn't push the backend to a git repository for a while? no idea, this is from years ago.
